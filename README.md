# Bayrol Cloud Integration for Home Assistant

⚠️ **BETA STATUS**: This integration is currently in beta. Please report any issues you encounter.

This is a Home Assistant Custom Component for the Bayrol Cloud. It allows you to monitor and control your pool's parameters and equipment directly in Home Assistant.

It currently only supports the German Bayrol Cloud services (https://www.bayrol-poolaccess.de), because I do not have access to others yet. If you can help with other Bayrol Cloud instances, open an issue. PRs are always welcome.

## Tested Devices

Currently tested with:
- BAYROL PoolRelax 3
- BAYROL Automatic Cl-pH
- Bayrol Automatic SALT AS7
- BAYROL Pool Manager 5

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Make sure you have [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) installed
2. Add this repository as a custom repository in HACS:
   - Click on HACS in the sidebar
   - Click on "Integrations"
   - Click the three dots in the top right corner
   - Select "Custom repositories"
   - Add `https://github.com/razem-io/ha-bayrol-cloud` as the repository URL
   - Select "Integration" as the category
3. Click "Install"
4. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/bayrol_cloud` directory to your Home Assistant's `custom_components` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

1. Go to Settings -> Devices & Services
2. Click "Add Integration"
3. Search for "Bayrol Cloud"
4. Enter your credentials:
   - Username (Email address used for Bayrol Pool Access)
   - Password
   - Optional: Settings password for advanced features
   - Optional: Custom refresh interval (30 seconds minimum)

The integration will automatically discover and add all pool controllers configured in your Bayrol Cloud account.

## Debug Mode

Each device comes with a debug switch that can be used to capture raw HTML responses from the Bayrol Cloud API. This is particularly useful when:
- Troubleshooting issues
- Adding support for new device types
- Understanding the data structure

### Using Debug Mode

1. Find your device's debug switch in Home Assistant:
   - Go to Settings -> Devices & Services
   - Click on your Bayrol Cloud device
   - Look for the switch named "[Device Name] Debug Mode"
   - Or find it directly as `switch.bayrol_cloud_CID_debug`

2. Enable debug mode:
   - Toggle the debug switch to ON
   - The integration will start capturing raw HTML responses

3. Access the debug information:
   - Go to Developer Tools -> States
   - Search for your debug switch entity (e.g., `switch.bayrol_cloud_CID_debug`)
   - Look in the attributes section
   - You'll find the raw HTML response under `debug_raw_html`

Example of accessing debug data:
```yaml
switch.bayrol_cloud_12345_debug:
  state: 'on'
  attributes:
    debug_raw_html: '<html>... raw HTML response from Bayrol Cloud API ...</html>'
    friendly_name: 'Pool Controller Debug Mode'
    icon: 'mdi:bug'
```

4. When finished:
   - Toggle the debug switch to OFF
   - Debug data will be cleared

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Home Assistant development environment
- SSH access to your Home Assistant instance
- `rsync` installed on your development machine

### Development Installation Script

A development installation script (`dev-install.sh`) is provided to easily update the integration on your Home Assistant instance during development.

The script can be run in several ways:

1. Using default settings (root@homeassistant.local):
   ```bash
   ./dev-install.sh
   ```

2. Specifying custom user and host:
   ```bash
   ./dev-install.sh -u admin -h 192.168.1.100
   ```

3. View help and available options:
   ```bash
   ./dev-install.sh --help
   ```
   
The script will:
- Sync the integration files to your Home Assistant instance
- Restart Home Assistant to apply changes
- Wait for Home Assistant to come back online

### Testing

A test script (`test_api.py`) is provided to verify the API connection before deploying to Home Assistant:

```bash
python test_api.py --username your@email.com --password yourpassword --cid yourcid
```

This will test:
- Authentication with Bayrol Cloud Access
- Data fetching for your pool controller
- Parsing of sensor values

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check that your credentials are correct
2. Ensure your Bayrol Cloud Access account is active and working
3. Check the Home Assistant logs for any error messages
4. Try running the test script to verify API connectivity
5. Enable debug mode to capture raw API responses

### Checking Component Logs

To enable debug logs for the Bayrol Cloud integration:

1. Add the following to your `configuration.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   logger:
     default: info
     logs:
       custom_components.bayrol_cloud: debug
   ```
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Access the logs through:
   - Home Assistant UI: Settings -> System -> Logs
   - Command line: `tail -f /config/home-assistant.log | grep bayrol_cloud`

The debug logs will show:
- API requests and responses
- Data updates from your pool controller
- Authentication status
- Any errors or issues that occur
